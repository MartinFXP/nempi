Title: Inferring unobserved perturbations from gene expression data
Version: 0.99.0
Authors@R: person("Martin", "Pirkl", email = "martinpirkl@yahoo.de",role = c("aut", "cre"))
Depends: R (>= 4.0)
Description: Takes as input an incomplete perturbation profile and differential gene expression in log odds and infers unobserved perturbations and augments observed ones. The inference is done by iteratively inferring a network from the perturbations and inferring perturbations from the network. The network inference is done by Nested Effects Models.
