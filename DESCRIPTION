Description: Takes as input an incomplete perturbation 
    profile and differential gene expression in log odds and 
    infers unobserved perturbations and augments observed 
    ones. The inference is done by iteratively inferring a 
    network from the perturbations and inferring perturbations 
    from the network. The network inference is done by 
    Nested Effects Models.
